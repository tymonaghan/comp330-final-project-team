## A collection of links and resources that might be useful during development
by Tyler Monaghan

#### SOTU-db
**[The development blog for the "State of the Union database"](https://blog.sotu-db.com)** contains info about existing development on the SOTU-db project

**[The SOTU-db GitHub repo](https://github.com/tymonaghan/sotu-db)** note especially the "speeches-" folders where you can find plaintext versions of the actual State of the Union addresses. "Speeches-gutenberg" is the most complete for now, "speeches-ucsb-pres-project" will ultimately be the best folder to use but I'm still compiling those texts.

#### NLP
**[The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/)** this seems to be the NLP package of choice among the DH/CS community that attended our DHCS conference over the weekend of Nov. 9-11 2018. I haven't worked with it yet myself (Tyler).

**["A Gentle Introduction to Text Mining using R - blog post/tutorial"](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/a-gentle-introduction-to-text-mining-using-r/)** this tutorial walks through the basics of text mining like text cleaning, tokenization, etc. with R. I used this to find the 20 most common terms in the SOTU texts, for example.

**[Voyant-Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)** this could be an effective "shortcut" to some of the NLP stuff we do, if we need it. An easy online tool, just input your texts, and it can quickly tell you whose sentences were longest/shortest, whose vocabulary was most/least dense, etc...

#### State of the Union addresses
**[UC-Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-documents-archive-guidebook/annual-messages-congress-the-state-the-union)** this is what I would consider the authoritative source on US Presidents' Annual Messages, better known as "State of the Union" addresses.
