- how much context/citation needs to be in each question? Like if the question is about "readability scores" where are we explaining our methodology for obtaining those scores? In the questions themselves, in a note at the bottom of the page, in a separate about document? Or are they linked from the questions somehow to encourage exploration of the SOTUs?

- for multiple choice questions (like which president had the most words per sentence), do we manually figure out 3 options or make the software able to generate the choices and determine the correct answer on its own?

- we are making separate files of questions and answers. Do we need to split this into three files (one for questions, one for a list of possible multiple choice answers, and a third with the correct answer and explanatory notes)?
